# Directory contents explorer using Excel spreadsheet (Spire Excel trial library)

An older project that uses spire xls/pdf to list a directory's file contents.

This was meant to be implemented in the future as a standalone windows form control but was left as-is because it runs great on its own (also needed to get a license for the spire library which was not feasible at that time).
